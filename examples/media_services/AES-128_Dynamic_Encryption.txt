AES-128 Dynamic Encryption and Key Delivery Service Workflow

The following are general steps that you would need to perform when encrypting your assets with AES, 
using the Media Services key delivery service, and also using dynamic encryption.

1 - Create an asset and upload files into the asset.
2 - Encode the asset containing the file to the adaptive bitrate MP4 set.
3 - Create a content key and associate it with the encoded asset. 
    In Media Services, the content key contains the asset’s encryption key.
4 - Configure the content key’s authorization policy. 
    The content key authorization policy must be configured by you and met by the client in order for the content key to be delivered to the client.
5 - Configure the delivery policy for an asset. The delivery policy configuration includes(*): 
    a) key acquisition URL and Initialization Vector (IV) (AES 128 requires the same IV to be supplied when encrypting and decrypting); 
    b) delivery protocol (for example, MPEG DASH, HLS, HDS, Smooth Streaming or all); 
    c) the type of dynamic encryption (for example, envelope or no dynamic encryption).
6) Create an OnDemand locator in order to get a streaming URL.

(*) You could apply different policy to each protocol on the same asset. 
    For example, you could apply PlayReady encryption to Smooth/DASH and AES Envelope to HLS. 
    Any protocols that are not defined in a delivery policy (for example, you add a single policy that only specifies HLS as the protocol) will be blocked from streaming. 
    The exception to this is if you have no asset delivery policy defined at all. Then, all protocols will be allowed in the clear.
